This document is a summary of the book Philosophy of Software Design.

## 3. Working code isn't enough
Be a strategical programmer instead of a tactical programmer. 

This is what being each other means:
- **Strategical programmers**: they won't accept to introduce unnecessary complexities to finish their tasks faster. The most important thing to them is the long-term structure of the system. They'll take a little extra time to find simpler designs for every implementation and to solve any design problem they find (they have an investment mindset).
- **Tactical programmer**: their main focus is to get something working without spending too much time thinking about the design.

If you implement a tactical programming approach, instead of continually making small improvements to the system design (strategical programming) you will be adding complexity.
