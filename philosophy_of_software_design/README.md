## Chapter 1
### Introduction
### (It's All About Complexity)

The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating. As a program evolves, complexity inevitably increases and the system becomes harder to understand, slowing down development and leading to bugs.
There are two general approaches to fighting complexity:
- Making code simpler and more obvious. For example, eliminating special cases or using identifiers in a consistent fashion.
- Encapsulate complexity, so that programmers can work on a system without being exposed to all of its complexity at once. This approach is called **modular design**, as the software system is divided up into modules designed to be relatively independent of each other.
