# Philosophy of Software Design

This document is a summary of the book Philosophy of Software Design.

## Working code isn't enough
Be a strategical programmer instead of a tactical programmer. 

Being a strategical programmer means that:
- It is not acceptable to you to introduce unnecessary complexities to finish your task faster.
- The most important thing to you is the long-term structure of the system.
- You'll take a little extra time to find simpler designs for every implementation of yours and to solve any design problem that you find (you have an investment mindset).

While being a tactical programmer means that your main focus is to get something working without spending too much time thinking about the design.

If you implement a tactical programming approach, instead of continually making small improvements to the system design (strategical programming) you will be adding complexity.
